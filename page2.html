        <p>I was prepared to whip out my pens and markers for your card again this year, but then I realized this is your day! The arts and crafts felt like they were more for me than they were for you -- it was just another excuse to play with my art supplies. So what if I did something that felt more <em>you</em>? <br> <br> P.S. Don't judge my code too hard lols, I started this like two days ago and I know like zilch about literally anything, like just a reminder that I didn't know what usb-c was like a year ago!!! IM VERY NOT TECH SAVVY!!</p>
